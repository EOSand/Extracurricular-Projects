# Minecraft Code

This repository contains datapacks and Java projects used in the creation of several Minecraft maps.

Each folder corresponds to a different project. For example, [Legend of the Blue Tide](https://github.com/EOSand/Minecraft-Code/tree/main/Legend-of-the-Blue-Tide) contains Minecraft code/functions included in the map while [MapToPNG](https://github.com/EOSand/Minecraft-Code/tree/main/MapToPNG) is a Java program which exports literal in-game maps as image files.

Feel free to examine the different files; this is but a location where I can share my programming experience outside of immediate discourse.
